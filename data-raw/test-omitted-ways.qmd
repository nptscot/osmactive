The aim of the code below is to test which ways are omitted by the `get_cycling_network` function.


```{r}
devtools::load_all()
library(tidyverse)
osm_national = get_travel_network("Scotland")
osm_trinity_crescent = osm_national |>
  filter(name == "Trinity Crescent") 
mapview::mapview(osm_trinity_crescent)

# Use browser() for interactive debugging in the following line:
devtools::load_all()
osm_trinity_filtered = get_cycling_network(osm_trinity_crescent)
mapview::mapview(osm_trinity_filtered)
```
