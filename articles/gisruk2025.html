<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Active travel is an accessible and cost-effective way to replace
short car trips and make transport systems more sustainable. The Network
Planning Tool (NPT) for Scotland is a new web-based strategic network
planning tool that estimates cycling potential down to the street level.
The NPT builds on the functionality of the Propensity to Cycle Tool
(PCT) and related tools <span class="citation">[@lovelace2017;
@goodman2019; @lovelace2024; @félix2025]</span>, offering a detailed
nationwide cycling potential analysis for Scotland. The NPT is funded by
Transport Scotland and developed by the University of Leeds in
collaboration with Sustrans Scotland. The tool is open-source and hosted
at <a href="https://github.com/nptscot" class="external-link">github.come/nptscot</a>,
enabling others to learn from and contribute to the underlying methods
to help make transport planning more open and participatory <span class="citation">[@lovelace2020a]</span>.</p>
<p>A unique feature of the NPT is its integration of multiple layers
into a single tool, overcoming limitations of previous strategic network
planning tools, which generally focus either on behaviour data (such as
the PCT) or physical infrastructure <span class="citation">[@vybornova2024; @vierø2024]</span>. The NPT brings
together more than a dozen datasets, including Ordnance Survey Mastermap
and OpenStreetmap data products to provide comprehensive data on the
potential for mode shift, infrastructure, modelled motor traffic levels,
and street space at the network level. This paper presents new
geographic methods we developed to support this work, with reference to
reproducible code that use the new <code>osmactive</code> R package for
classifying national-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) datasets based on
attributes and geographic relationships, and the <code>anime</code> Rust
crate for astonishingly fast and accurate route network data
integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="datasets-and-methods">Datasets and methods<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#datasets-and-methods"></a>
</h2>
<p>The NPT uses datasets from diverse sources including from the DfT’s
network of traffic sensors, motor traffic counts based a survey
evaluating Edinburgh’s roll-out of 20 mph speed limits, the National
Travel Survey, and the Scottish Household Travel Survey. We used four
key datasets representing the road network for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordnance Survey OpenRoads, an open access and simplified
representation of the road network that is ideal for visualisation</li>
<li>OS MasterMap Highways, a more detailed dataset that includes
information on road widths and other features</li>
<li>OS Mastermap Topography, the most detailed vector dataset that
includes detailed information on the geometry of many features of the
man-made environment, including curb lines. In the OS Topo layer roads
and other pieces of transport infrastructure such as footways
(pavements) are represented not as corridor or lane centerlines, but as
polygons.</li>
<li>OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced dataset that is continuously updated
by community volunteers. The dataset is rich, with tags for width and
smoothness of infrastructure, but is not as consistent as the OS
datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordnance Survey’s MasterMap Highways and Topography datasets provide
unparalleled accuracy and detail, but are a struggle to import using
consumer-grade hardware and standard tools such as QGIS. To overcome
this issue we developed <a href="https://github.com/acteng/mastermapr" class="external-link">the <code>mastermapr</code>
package</a> in collaboration with the government agency Active Travel
England (ATE), to efficiently and flexibly imports MasterMap datasets
(50 GB compressed). After importing the four route network datasets
outlined above, we integrated them using the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pavement widths were calculated from the OS MasterMap Topography
dataset using the function <code>get_pavement_widths()</code> from the
<code>osmactive</code> package. This function calculates the width of
manmade roadside features associated with each road segment by dividing
the area of matching polygons associated with each road segment by the
length of the road segment.</li>
<li>The <code><a href="../reference/get_bus_routes.html">get_bus_routes()</a></code> function from the
<code>osmactive</code> package was used to determine the number of bus
lanes on each road segment.</li>
<li>We used the <code>anime</code> Rust crate to efficiently join the
networks, based on alignment and proximity. The use of spatial indexes
makes the implementation highly efficient compared with the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/reference/rnet_join.html" class="external-link"><code>rnet_join()</code></a>
function in the R package <code>stplanr</code> that we were using
previously. See the <a href="https://github.com/JosiahParry/anime" class="external-link">josiahparry/ANIME codebase
on GitHub</a> for details of the new algorithm and its implementation as
an R (and planned Python) interface to the new <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anime" class="external-link"><code>anime</code> Rust
crate</a>.</li>

<h3 id="road-width-measurements">Road width measurements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#road-width-measurements"></a>
</h3>
<p>Two key measurements are needed to assess whether existing roads can
accommodate cycle infrastructure: carriageway width and corridor width,
as defined below.</p>
<p>Accurate and available carriageway width measurements are important
because they determine if proposed infrastructure can fit solely within
the carriageway, without the need for moving curbs or other roadside
features. The Scottish Cycling by Design (CbD) guidance document
outlines three types of cycle infrastructure that run along the
carriageway, building on Department for Transport guidance <span class="citation">[@departmentfortransport2020]</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cycle track at carriageway level</li>
<li>Stepped cycle track</li>
<li>Cycle track at footway level</li>
</ul>
<p>The first option, cycle track that is at carriage level, has
additional advantages over stepped cycleway, being often cheaper to
construct <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/media/50323/cycling-by-design-update-2019-final-document-15-september-2021-1.pdf#page=76" class="external-link">with
no new tarmac required in many cases</a> but requires sufficient width
on the existing carriageway to accommodate the cycle infrastructure.</p>
<p>Corridor width captures the carriageway plus any built roadside
features, such as footways. The following <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/" class="external-link"><code>dplyr</code> query</a> was
used to extract the width of manmade roadside features:
<code>filter(descriptive_group == "Roadside", make == "Manmade")</code>.
From that point, we calculated the width of pavements associated with
each road segment by dividing the area of matching polygons associated
with each road segment by the length of the road segment, as implemented
in the <code>get_pavement_widths()</code> function in the
<code>osmactive</code> package.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="minimum-cycle-track-and-buffer-widths">Minimum cycle track and buffer widths<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#minimum-cycle-track-and-buffer-widths"></a>
</h3>
<p>The corridor width is important because it determines whether, in
cases where there is insufficient space on the carriageway, part of the
footway or other manmade roadside features may be reallocated for cycle
infrastructure, while still maintaining recommended minimum widths for
pedestrians. CbD guidance on widths is summarised in table <span class="citation">@tbl-cbd</span>.</p>

<h3 id="bus-routes-and-road-traffic-assumptions">Bus routes and road traffic assumptions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bus-routes-and-road-traffic-assumptions"></a>
</h3>
<p>The minimum space requirements for motor traffic depend on the uses
of the road, including whether it is a bus route and whether there are
dedicated bus lanes. Based on the Active Travel England cross section
check tool, part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/active-travel-england-design-assistance-tools" class="external-link">Active
Travel England’s open access Excel-based design tools</a> (see <a href="https://acteng.github.io/inspectorate_tools/" class="external-link">acteng.github.io/inspectorate_tools/</a>
for web-based versions), we assumed the following widths for motor
traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-bus routes: 2 × 2.75 m</li>
<li>Bus routes without dedicated bus lanes: 2 × 3.2 m</li>
<li>Bus routes with dedicated bus lanes: 2 × 3.2 m plus an additional
space of <code>n_bus_lanes</code> × 3.2 m for the dedicated bus
lanes.</li>
</ul>
<!-- https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1Xaf --><p>The number of bus lanes was determined from the OSM data with the
function <a href="https://nptscot.github.io/osmactive/reference/get_bus_routes.html"><code>get_bus_routes()</code></a>
in the R package <code>osmactive</code> that we developed for this
project. The results are illustrated in <span class="citation">@fig-edinburgh-bus-lanes</span>, which can also be

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>The Network Planning Tool for Scotland is a cutting-edge web
application designed for strategic cycle network planning. A unique
feature of the NPT is its integration of multiple layers into a single
tool, overcoming limitations of previous strategic network planning
tools, which generally focus either on behaviour data or physical
infrastructure. The new street space layer represents a step change in
access to combined carriageway and corridor widths, the first time this
data has been made available at a national level, to the best of our
knowledge.</p>
<p>In future work we plan to improve the NPT by incorporating new
datasets from a variety of sources, including <a href="https://data.spatialhub.scot" class="external-link">Scotland’s Spatial Hub</a>. We would
like to develop context-specific classifications in the
<code>osmactive</code> package to better address the diverse needs of
different urban environments and support the roll-out the methods in new
places.</p>

Would you like to be considered for the GoFundGeo Grant?

The GISRUK & OSGeo:UK GoFundGeo grant is an annual £500 award for GISRUK presenters (oral or poster) who present a tool or technique that has potential for wide uptake in the open source geospatial (OSGeo) community. The purpose of the grant is to help the recipient to make their approach easily adoptable through the provision of open source code repository and/or tool (e.g. a QGIS plugin). This grant is open to all, but with a focus on ECRs.


If you would like your submission to be considered for this award, please specify how the £500 grant would enable you to do to develop your code or method into a reusable tool.

It would allow the osmactive R package to be developed to match the guidance for minimum standards in other countries, including Portugal (led by Rosa Félix) and Norway (led by Ray Pritchard), for the benefit of transport planners worldwide. We will do a call for community input to crowd source input from the OSM and active travel advocacy groups internationally as part of the grant process, which will fund a hackathon (travel and sustenance) on the package. See https://github.com/nptscot/osmactive for details. -->
