The default classification is the Cycling by Design guidance from the Scottish Government. The following code shows how we implemented it.

# Transport Scotland's Cycling by Design classification

The level of service associated with each link can be calculated based on the Level of Service table in the Cycling by Design guidance:

<!-- A tabular representation of this data is as follows, after translating CbD infrastructure categories into NPT categories: -->

```{r}

  transmute(
    `Speed (85th kph)` = `Motor Traffic Speed (85th percentile)`,
    `Speed Limit (mph)` = `Speed Limit (mph)`,
    AADT = `Two-way traffic flow (pcu per day)`,
    `Mixed Traffic Street`,
    `Off road cycleway` = `Detached or Remote Cycle Track`,
    `Segregated Track (wide)` = `Cycle Track at Carriageway Level`,
    `Segregated Track (narrow)` = `Light Segregation`,

  )

```

<!-- We can convert this table into a 'long' format for use internally. -->

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
los_table_long = los_table_npt |>
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(`Speed (85th kph)`, `Speed Limit (mph)`, AADT),

write_csv(los_table_long, "inst/extdata/level-of-service-table-long.csv")
usethis::use_data(los_table_long, overwrite = TRUE)
```

<!-- Next, we calculate the speed limits. -->

```{r}
#| eval: false

cycle_net_speeds = clean_speeds(cycle_net)
# table(cycle_net_speeds$maxspeed_clean)
#  15  20  30  40  50  60 
#   1 314 239  92   2  22
classify_speeds = function(speed_mph) {
  dplyr::case_when(
    speed_mph < 20 ~ "<20 mph",
    speed_mph < 30 ~ "20 mph",
    speed_mph < 40 ~ "30 mph",
    speed_mph < 50 ~ "40 mph",
    speed_mph < 60 ~ "50 mph",
    speed_mph >= 60 ~ "60+ mph"
  )
}
classify_speeds(30)
classify_speeds(10)
classify_speeds(NA)
```

We can then create the `Speed Limit (mph)` and `AADT` columns in the `cycle_net` object:

```{r}
cycle_net_speeds = clean_speeds(cycle_net)
cycle_net_volumes = estimate_traffic(cycle_net_speeds)
cycle_net$`Speed Limit (mph)` = classify_speeds(cycle_net_speeds$maxspeed_clean)
cycle_net$AADT = npt_to_cbd_aadt_numeric(cycle_net_volumes$assumed_volume)
table(cycle_net$`Speed Limit (mph)`)
table(cycle_net$AADT)
```

Finally, we can calculate the level of service for each link:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
los_table_long_mini = los_table_long |>
  select(-`Speed (85th kph)`) |>
  rename(cycle_segregation = infrastructure)

table(cycle_net_los$level_of_service)
# Count the NAs by infrastructure type, speed limit and AADT:
los_table_nas = cycle_net_los |>
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |>
  group_by(`Speed Limit (mph)`, AADT, cycle_segregation) |>
  summarise(na = sum(is.na(level_of_service))) |>
  filter(na > 0) |>
  arrange(desc(na))

# Testing the classification

```{r}
osm = osm_edinburgh
cycle_net = get_cycling_network(osm)
drive_net = get_driving_network(osm)
drive_net_major = get_driving_network(osm)
cycle_net = distance_to_road(cycle_net, drive_net)
cycle_net = classify_cycle_infrastructure(cycle_net)
table(cycle_net$detailed_segregation)
table(cycle_net$cycle_segregation)
```

```{r minimal_plot_osm}
m = plot_osm_tmap(cycle_net)
m
```

Let's try running the code on a larger example, covering Edinburgh:

```{r edinburgh}
osm = get_travel_network("Edinburgh")
cycle_net = get_cycling_network(osm)
drive_net = get_driving_network(osm)
cycle_net = distance_to_road(cycle_net, drive_net)
cycle_net = classify_cycle_infrastructure(cycle_net)
central_edinburgh = osm_edinburgh |>
  sf::st_union() |>
  sf::st_centroid() |>
  sf::st_buffer(3000)
m = plot_osm_tmap(cycle_net[central_edinburgh, ])
m
```

We can pick out specific bits of infrastructure, e.g. those mentioned in issue [#67](https://github.com/nptscot/osmactive/issues/67): 

> https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1137759929 shows up as this right now, but this looks like a narrow segregated / stepped track to me. https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1209807768 is another case that doesn't seem like off-road.

> My idea of off-road cycleway were things like https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/7973833 and https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/265320503 -- things with no parallel road nearby.

Let's pull out those bits of infrastructure:

```{r}
cycle_net_included = cycle_net |>
  subset(osm_id %in% c(1137759929, 1209807768, 7973833, 265320503))
names(cycle_net_included)
cycle_net_included[c("osm_id", "distance_to_road", "cycle_segregation")] |>
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |>
  knitr::kable()
```

We can also plot these as follows:

```{r}
m = plot_osm_tmap(cycle_net_included)
m
```
