abstract: |
  Evidence on street networks and their potential changes under future scenarios is crucial for active travel planning. However, most active travel models rely on oversimplified street representations, using single variables like 'quietness', neglecting key factors such as footway widths. This paper introduces new methods for classifying street networks for active travel, integrating diverse datasets from OpenStreetMap and official sources. Implemented in open source software packages `osmactive` and `anime`, these methods are scalable and reproducible. The results are showcased in a web application hosted at www.npt.scot, demonstrating how geographic data science can drive high-impact research.

<!-- # Background

From the manual at https://github.com/nptscot/nptscot.github.io/blob/dev/manual/index.md?plain=1:

Welcome to the Network Planning Tool (NPT) for Scotland, a cutting-edge web application designed for strategic cycle network planning. Funded by Transport Scotland and developed by the University of Leeds in collaboration with Sustrans Scotland. It builds on the functionality of the [Propensity to Cycle Tool](https://www.pct.bike/) for England and Wales, offering a detailed nationwide cycling potential analysis for Scotland, down to the street level ([Lovelace et al. 2017](https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/862)). We invite users to explore its comprehensive features and contribute feedback for continuous improvement.

### NPT overview

The NPT is Scotland’s nationwide web-based strategic network planning tool that estimates cycling potential down to the street level.

The easiest way to access the NPT website is hosted at [www.npt.scot](http://www.npt.scot).

The NPT includes:

1.  the [map user interface](https://www.npt.scot/), 
2.  a series of open access [data downloads](https://www.npt.scot/data) that can be analysed in GIS software or statistical software, 
3.  the [code base](https://github.com/nptscot/) that can be modified to fix bugs, add new features, and develop new scenarios.

The NPT is an open-source tool, meaning the source code is transparent and in the public domain for others to learn from and build on. The code underlying the project is available to be copied and improved by the community.

The online interface can serve many needs, including gaining insight into the network of routes where cycling potential is highest and quantifying the benefits of cycling uptake. However, we recommend that intermediate and advanced users download data on zones, routes and route networks for in-house analysis.

The NPT allows users to visualise results baseline data and how cycling would change under different scenarios. The journey purposes and scenarios are described in detail below.

## NPT user interface guide

The NPT's user interface is intuitive, featuring map controls for easy navigation and layer controls to customize data visibility. Whether you're interested in the baseline cycling data or exploring various "what-if" scenarios like "Go Dutch" or ebike adoption, the tool provides a flexible platform for in-depth analysis.

<!-- The Street Space layer categorises roads in accordance with the [Cycling by Design guidance](https://www.transport.gov.scot/media/50323/cycling-by-design-update-2019-final-document-15-september-2021-1.pdf#page=68). It specifies the methodology for classifying road spaces and cycle infrastructure. The sections below describe the measurement methods for roads, the cycle infrastructure types considered, and the assumptions regarding bus routes and road types.

#### Road width measurements

Two key measurements are taken to assess whether existing roads can accommodate cycle infrastructure:

##### Carriageway width 
   
- **Definition:** The width available within the carriageway only.
- **Excludes:** Manmade roadside area such as footways.
- **Usage:** Determines if cycle infrastructure can fit solely within the carriageway.

##### Corridor width (Edge to edge)

- **Definition:** The total width of the corridor, encompassing both the carriageway and manmade roadside features (e.g., pavements). 
- **Usage:** Where local policy allows, part of the footway or other manmade roadside features may be reallocated for cycle infrastructure, provided that minimum safe footway widths are maintained.

#### Cycle infrastructure width requirements

Two main types of cycle infrastructure are considered, depending on the street configuration:

Unidirectional Cycle Tracks (2 × 1-Way Protected Cycle Tracks):
  - *Absolute Minimum Width:* 1.5 m  
  - *Desirable Minimum Width:* 2.0 m  

Bidirectional Cycle Tracks (1 × 2-Way Protected Cycle Track):
  - *Absolute Minimum Width:* 2.0 m
  - *Desirable Minimum Width:* 3.0 m

#### Buffers for cycle infrastructure

Buffers are applied based on road speed and traffic conditions, as specified in Table 3.8 of the Cycling by Design document. These buffers must be accounted for when calculating the effective available width for cycle infrastructure.


#### Bus routes and road traffic assumptions

##### Bus routes and dedicated bus lanes

Bus routes and dedicated bus lanes are key factors in determining the available space for cycle infrastructure:

- **Non-bus routes:**  
  The motor traffic space is considered as **2 × 2.75 m**.

- **Bus routes without dedicated bus lanes:**  
  The motor traffic space is considered as **2 × 3.2 m**.

- **Bus routes with dedicated bus lanes:**  
  The motor traffic space is considered as **2 × 3.2 m** plus an additional space of **`n_bus_lanes` × 3.2 m** for the dedicated bus lanes.

##### Road types

Roads are categorised based on their traffic configuration and bus route status:
- Two‐way for motor traffic (non–bus route)
- Two‐way for motor traffic (bus route without dedicated bus lanes)
- Two‐way for motor traffic (bus route with dedicated bus lanes)

#### Categorisation based on available width

The Street Space layer divides roads into three groups, depending on whether the available width (carriageway width or corridor width) can accommodate the cycle infrastructure:

- **Not enough space:**
  The available space is insufficient to fit even the absolute minimum width of cycle infrastructure.

- **Absolute minimum:**
  The available space is enough to accommodate the absolute minimum width of cycle infrastructure, but it does not meet the desirable minimum.

- **Desirable minimum:**
  The available space is sufficient to accommodate the desirable minimum width of cycle infrastructure, providing a more comfortable design for all users. -->

# Introduction

Active travel is an accessible and cost-effective way to replace short car trips and make transport systems more sustainable.
The Network Planning Tool (NPT) for Scotland is a new web-based strategic network planning tool that estimates cycling potential down to the street level.
The NPT builds on the functionality of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) and related tools [@lovelace2017; @goodman2019; @lovelace2024; @félix2025], offering a detailed nationwide cycling potential analysis for Scotland.
The NPT is funded by Transport Scotland and developed by the University of Leeds in collaboration with Sustrans Scotland.
The tool is open-source and hosted at [github.come/nptscot](https://github.com/nptscot), enabling others to learn from and contribute to the underlying methods to help make transport planning more open and participatory [@lovelace2020a].

A unique feature of the NPT is its integration of multiple layers into a single tool, overcoming limitations of previous strategic network planning tools, which generally focus either on behaviour data (such as the PCT) or physical infrastructure [@vybornova2024; @vierø2024].
The NPT brings together more than a dozen datasets, including Ordnance Survey Mastermap and OpenStreetmap data products to provide comprehensive data on the potential for mode shift, infrastructure, modelled motor traffic levels, and street space at the network level.
This paper presents new geographic methods we developed to support this work, with reference to reproducible code that use the new `osmactive` R package for classifying national-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) datasets based on attributes and geographic relationships, and the `anime` Rust crate for astonishingly fast and accurate route network data integration.

# Datasets and methods

The NPT uses datasets from diverse sources including from the DfT's network of traffic sensors, motor traffic counts based a survey evaluating Edinburgh's roll-out of 20 mph speed limits, the National Travel Survey, and the Scottish Household Travel Survey.
We used four key datasets representing the road network for this project:

-   Ordnance Survey OpenRoads, an open access and simplified representation of the road network that is ideal for visualisation
-   OS MasterMap Highways, a more detailed dataset that includes information on road widths and other features
-   OS Mastermap Topography, the most detailed vector dataset that includes detailed information on the geometry of many features of the man-made environment, including curb lines. In the OS Topo layer roads and other pieces of transport infrastructure such as footways (pavements) are represented not as corridor or lane centerlines, but as polygons.
-   OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced dataset that is continuously updated by community volunteers. The dataset is rich, with tags for width and smoothness of infrastructure, but is not as consistent as the OS datasets.

Ordnance Survey’s MasterMap Highways and Topography datasets provide unparalleled accuracy and detail, but are a struggle to import using consumer-grade hardware and standard tools such as QGIS.
To overcome this issue we developed [the `mastermapr` package](https://github.com/acteng/mastermapr) in collaboration with the government agency Active Travel England (ATE), to efficiently and flexibly imports MasterMap datasets (50 GB compressed).
After importing the four route network datasets outlined above, we integrated them using the following steps:

-   Pavement widths were calculated from the OS MasterMap Topography dataset using the function `get_pavement_widths()` from the `osmactive` package. This function calculates the width of manmade roadside features associated with each road segment by dividing the area of matching polygons associated with each road segment by the length of the road segment.
-   The `get_bus_routes()` function from the `osmactive` package was used to determine the number of bus lanes on each road segment.
-   We used the `anime` Rust crate to efficiently join the networks, based on alignment and proximity. The use of spatial indexes makes the implementation highly efficient compared with the [`rnet_join()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/reference/rnet_join.html) function in the R package `stplanr` that we were using previously. See the [josiahparry/ANIME codebase on GitHub](https://github.com/JosiahParry/anime) for details of the new algorithm and its implementation as an R (and planned Python) interface to the new [`anime` Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/anime).

## Classifying OpenStreetNetwork ways

Functions including `get_travel_network()` and `classify_cycle_infrastructure()` from the `osmactive` package were used to classify cycle infrastructure types based on the presence of cycle lanes, tracks, and other features (see the code snippet which generates @fig-bristol below).

```{r}
#| label: bristol
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
osm = get_travel_network("bristol")
cycle_net = get_cycling_network(osm)
drive_net = get_driving_network(osm)
cycle_net = distance_to_road(cycle_net, drive_net)
cycle_net = classify_cycle_infrastructure(cycle_net)
plot_osm_tmap(cycle_net)
```

<!-- Save an interactive version of the map to check the resu lts as follows: -->

```{r}

  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "top"))

## Road width measurements

Two key measurements are needed to assess whether existing roads can accommodate cycle infrastructure: carriageway width and corridor width, as defined below.

Accurate and available carriageway width measurements are important because they determine if proposed infrastructure can fit solely within the carriageway, without the need for moving curbs or other roadside features.
The Scottish Cycling by Design (CbD) guidance document outlines three types of cycle infrastructure that run along the carriageway, building on Department for Transport guidance [@departmentfortransport2020]:

-   Cycle track at carriageway level
-   Stepped cycle track
-   Cycle track at footway level

The first option, cycle track that is at carriage level, has additional advantages over stepped cycleway, being often cheaper to construct [with no new tarmac required in many cases](https://www.transport.gov.scot/media/50323/cycling-by-design-update-2019-final-document-15-september-2021-1.pdf#page=76) but requires sufficient width on the existing carriageway to accommodate the cycle infrastructure.

Corridor width captures the carriageway plus any built roadside features, such as footways.
The following [`dplyr` query](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) was used to extract the width of manmade roadside features: `filter(descriptive_group == "Roadside", make == "Manmade")`.
From that point, we calculated the width of pavements associated with each road segment by dividing the area of matching polygons associated with each road segment by the length of the road segment, as implemented in the `get_pavement_widths()` function in the `osmactive` package.

## Minimum cycle track and buffer widths

The corridor width is important because it determines whether, in cases where there is insufficient space on the carriageway, part of the footway or other manmade roadside features may be reallocated for cycle infrastructure, while still maintaining recommended minimum widths for pedestrians.
CbD guidance on widths is summarised in table @tbl-cbd.

| Cycle infrastructure type  | Absolute minimum width | Desirable minimum width |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Unidirectional cycle track | 1.5 m                  | 2.0 m                   |
| Bidirectional cycle track  | 2.0 m                  | 3.0 m                   |

: Table illustrating the minimum width requirements for cycle infrastructure according to the Cycling by Design (CbD) guidance. {#tbl-cbd}

CbD also specifies buffers that must be accounted for when calculating the effective available width for cycle infrastructure (@tbl-buffers).

| Road type / Speed limit | Buffer width |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| 30 mph                  | 0.5 m        |
| 40 mph                  | 1.0 m        |
| 50 mph                  | 2.0 m        |
| 60 mph                  | 2.5 m        |
| 70 mph                  | 3.5 m        |

: Table illustrating the buffer widths for cycle infrastructure based on road type and speed limit according to the Cycling by Design (CbD) guidance. {#tbl-buffers}

Speed limit data taken from OSM was used to determine the buffer width for each road segment.

## Bus routes and road traffic assumptions

The minimum space requirements for motor traffic depend on the uses of the road, including whether it is a bus route and whether there are dedicated bus lanes.
Based on the Active Travel England cross section check tool, part of [Active Travel England's open access Excel-based design tools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/active-travel-england-design-assistance-tools) (see [acteng.github.io/inspectorate_tools/](https://acteng.github.io/inspectorate_tools/) for web-based versions), we assumed the following widths for motor traffic:

-   Non-bus routes: 2 × 2.75 m
-   Bus routes without dedicated bus lanes: 2 × 3.2 m
-   Bus routes with dedicated bus lanes: 2 × 3.2 m plus an additional space of `n_bus_lanes` × 3.2 m for the dedicated bus lanes.

<!-- https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1Xaf -->

The number of bus lanes was determined from the OSM data with the function [`get_bus_routes()`](https://nptscot.github.io/osmactive/reference/get_bus_routes.html) in the R package `osmactive` that we developed for this project.
The results are illustrated in @fig-edinburgh-bus-lanes, which can also be reproduced with the following [Overpass Turbo query](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1Xaf):

```         
relation["route"="bus"]({{bbox}});
```

# Results

The result of the data engineering, data integration, modelling and visualisation steps described above is datasets that are visualised interactively in the NPT web application, using `pmtiles` for efficient rendering of large datasets [@gonçalves2023].
The key components of the NPT are:

-   The "Route network" layer, presenting data on cycling potential on OSM-based and simplified [@lovelace_reproducible_2024] network layers.
-   The "Infrastructure and traffic" layer, which includes data on motor traffic levels and cycle infrastructure.
-   The "Street space" layer, which categorises roads in accordance with the Cycling by Design guidance, specifying the methodology for classifying road spaces and cycle infrastructure, presented in @fig-street-space.
-   The "Core network" layer, representing a cohesive network that could be a priority when planning new infrastructure.
-   The [Network Planning Workspace (NPW)](https://nptscot.github.io/npw/) web application, which allows users to explore the data and create custom scenarios of infrastructure change.

# Conclusion

The Network Planning Tool for Scotland is a cutting-edge web application designed for strategic cycle network planning.
A unique feature of the NPT is its integration of multiple layers into a single tool, overcoming limitations of previous strategic network planning tools, which generally focus either on behaviour data or physical infrastructure.
The new street space layer represents a step change in access to combined carriageway and corridor widths, the first time this data has been made available at a national level, to the best of our knowledge.

In future work we plan to improve the NPT by incorporating new datasets from a variety of sources, including [Scotland's Spatial Hub](https://data.spatialhub.scot).
We also plan to roll-out the methods in new places and welcome feedback from the community on how to improve the tool.

The purpose of the grant is to help the recipient to make their approach easily adoptable through the provision of open source code repository and/or tool (e.g. a QGIS plugin). This grant is open to all, but with a focus on ECRs.


If you would like your submission to be considered for this award, please specify how the £500 grant would enable you to do to develop your code or method into a reusable tool.

It would allow the osmactive R package to be developed to match the guidance for minimum standards in other countries, including Portugal (led by Rosa Félix) and Norway (led by Ray Pritchard), for the benefit of transport planners worldwide. We will do a call for community input to crowd source input from the OSM and active travel advocacy groups internationally as part of the grant process, which will fund a hackathon (travel and sustenance) on the package.
